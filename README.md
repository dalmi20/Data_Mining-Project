# University Admission Prediction

Predicting university admissions using data mining and machine learning techniques. This mini-project explores both supervised and unsupervised learning methods to predict the likelihood of admission for prospective students.

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a mini-project focused on predicting university admissions. The project utilizes a dataset comprising historical admission data, including features such as GPA, test scores, extracurricular activities, etc.

## Techniques Used

- **Supervised Learning:**
  - Implemented various supervised learning algorithms such as decision trees, and random forests to predict admission outcomes.
  - Evaluated and compared the performance of these models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

- **Unsupervised Learning:**
  - Employed unsupervised learning techniques, including clustering algorithms like k-means, to identify patterns within the data.
  - Explored insights into different clusters of applicants and their characteristics.
